--Areas you would like us to pay special attention to.

finish them.

Thorougly testing all the endpoints against all possible use cases
Complete the documentation of the end points

--Anything else you feel we should know about e.g. if you used a design pattern that we
should note.

I chose to create separate schemas for comments and, posts even though comments could have been a array of sub-documents in the post for obvious reasons of scalability and the question of padding on the mongodb server.

Do note that any commit sent in after the slated time will not be considered.
Kindly treat this assessment as you would a regular work project, with progressive
commits.
